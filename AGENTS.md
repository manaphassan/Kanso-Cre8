# SS-CAM AGENT RULES

## Project

SS-CAM is the SuamiSihat Creative Assets Management desktop application.

Platform:

Windows Desktop

Technology:

- C#
- WPF
- .NET Framework 4.8
- WPF-UI
- Fluent 2
- MVVM architecture

---

# CORE PRINCIPLE

Treat SS-CAM as a production application used by working designers.

Prioritize:

1. Reliability
2. Data safety
3. Functional correctness
4. Predictable UX
5. Fluent 2 consistency
6. Accessibility
7. Maintainability
8. Performance

Do not optimize for code cleverness.

---

# BEFORE CHANGING CODE

Always:

1. Inspect the existing implementation.
2. Understand the affected feature.
3. Identify dependencies.
4. Identify existing reusable components.
5. Identify existing business logic.
6. Determine the root cause.
7. Make the smallest safe change.
8. Build.
9. Test.
10. Regression test affected functionality.

Never rewrite a working feature without a clear reason.

---

# UI/UX RULES

Use Fluent 2 as the primary design-system reference.

Prefer:

- Existing project components
- Existing design tokens
- Existing resources
- Existing WPF-UI components
- Existing icon system

Do not create a new component when an existing component can reasonably support the requirement.

Do not introduce visually different versions of an existing component without a semantic reason.

---

# COMPONENT RULE

ONE PURPOSE = ONE CANONICAL COMPONENT

Before creating a new:

- Button
- Dialog
- Card
- Input
- Navigation item
- Status indicator
- Notification
- Tooltip

search the project for an existing implementation.

If one exists, reuse or extend it.

---

# TERMINOLOGY RULE

ONE CONCEPT = ONE CANONICAL NAME.

Before introducing user-facing terminology:

Search the application for existing terminology.

Do not introduce:

`Create Project`

if the application already uses:

`Project Creator`

unless there is a deliberate semantic distinction.

Avoid inconsistent naming such as:

- Project / Job
- Create / Generate
- Delete / Remove
- Settings / Preferences
- User / Designer

unless they represent genuinely different concepts.

---

# DUPLICATION RULE

Before creating logic:

Search for existing implementations.

Avoid:

- Duplicate services
- Duplicate ViewModels
- Duplicate commands
- Duplicate validation
- Duplicate filesystem logic
- Duplicate API calls
- Duplicate UI components
- Duplicate styles
- Duplicate terminology

If duplication is found, determine whether it is:

KEEP

MERGE

REMOVE

or

DIFFERENTIATE

Do not remove code without understanding its purpose.

---

# FILESYSTEM SAFETY

SS-CAM performs real filesystem operations.

Treat filesystem operations as HIGH RISK.

Never blindly:

- Delete files
- Delete directories
- Overwrite existing files
- Move user files
- Modify files outside the intended workspace

Always validate:

- Source path
- Destination path
- File existence
- Directory existence
- Permissions
- Invalid characters
- Path traversal
- Network paths
- UNC paths

For destructive operations:

Require appropriate confirmation.

---

# DATA SAFETY

Never modify production/user data during testing unless explicitly instructed.

Use:

- Test workspace
- Temporary directories
- Mock data
- Disposable test files

When testing file generation or copying:

Verify the actual resulting filesystem state.

Do not consider a notification saying "Success" proof of success.

---

# NETWORK / NAS SAFETY

SS-CAM interacts with Synology/NAS resources.

Network failures must be treated as expected operating conditions.

Handle:

- Offline NAS
- Timeout
- Connection failure
- Permission failure
- Missing share
- Missing directory
- Slow response
- Interrupted operation

Never allow a network failure to freeze the UI.

---

# BACKGROUND OPERATIONS

Network, filesystem, scanning, copying, streaming, polling and other potentially expensive operations must not unnecessarily block the WPF UI thread.

Watch for:

- `.Result`
- `.Wait()`
- synchronous network calls
- synchronous filesystem scans
- timer leaks
- duplicated polling
- unbounded background tasks

Use asynchronous patterns where appropriate.

---

# ERROR HANDLING

Never silently swallow exceptions.

Avoid:

```csharp
catch
{
}
```

Errors should be:

1. Detected
2. Logged appropriately
3. Communicated appropriately
4. Recoverable where possible

Do not expose unnecessary technical information to normal users.

---

# UI STATES

Important operations should account for:

- Default
- Hover
- Focus
- Disabled
- Loading
- Success
- Error
- Empty

Where applicable also support:

- Offline
- Permission denied
- Not configured
- Missing resource

---

# ACCESSIBILITY

Important functionality must be usable through:

- Keyboard
- Visible focus
- Logical Tab order
- Accessible names
- Semantic controls
- Appropriate tooltips

Do not make icon-only controls dependent solely on visual recognition.

---

# TESTING RULE

Never claim:

"PASS"

unless the behaviour has actually been verified.

Allowed statuses:

PASS
FAIL
PARTIAL
BLOCKED
N/A

---

# BUILD RULE

After meaningful code changes:

1. Build.
2. Run tests.
3. Launch application where possible.
4. Test the affected workflow.
5. Check logs/errors.
6. Perform regression testing.

Never leave the repository knowingly unable to build.

---

# CHANGE CONTROL

Do not:

- Disable tests
- Delete tests
- Suppress errors without investigation
- Remove features to make tests pass
- Change business rules without justification
- Introduce unnecessary dependencies
- Rewrite architecture unnecessarily

---

# QA ARTIFACTS

Keep QA documentation under:

`/QA/`

Update relevant QA documents when testing or fixing functionality.

---

# AGENT BEHAVIOUR

Be conservative with destructive operations.

Prefer:

READ → ANALYZE → PROPOSE → CHANGE → VERIFY

over:

CHANGE → HOPE → APOLOGIZE

If a potentially destructive action is required, stop and request confirmation unless the action is explicitly authorized by the current task.

---

# DEFINITION OF DONE

A feature is not done merely because:

- Code compiles
- UI appears
- A button exists
- A notification appears

A feature is done when:

**The intended user action produces the intended real-world result and the resulting state is verified.**
