- **High-Velocity Desktop Navigation Engine (`MainWindow.xaml`, `WorkspaceScanner.cs`, `DashboardModels.cs`)**:
  - Configured `NavigationCacheMode="Required"` across all 15 navigation views in the desktop application. Tab navigation is now instantaneous (0 ms), retaining active state, scroll position, search filters, and loaded view models without re-inflating XAML BAML trees or garbage-collecting active pages.
  - Completely eliminated synchronous recursive `Directory.GetDirectories` crawling on the UI thread in `DashboardPage.xaml.cs`.
  - Shifted `ActiveWipProjects` computation to the background thread in `WorkspaceScanner.ScanAsync` and surfaced directly via `DashboardSnapshot`.
  - Converted synchronous folder scans in `CalendarPage.xaml.cs` and `TaskManagerPage.xaml.cs` to run via non-blocking `await Task.Run(...)`.
  - Converted directory search in `OrderRequestsPage.xaml.cs` to asynchronous execution to eliminate UI stutter when selecting order cards.
  - Resolved `System.InvalidCastException` in `OrderRequestsPage.xaml` by extracting `ContextMenu` into a statically referenced page resource (`OrderCardContextMenu`).
- **Canva Creative Cloud Bridge in Project Creator (`ProjectCreatorPage.xaml`, `ProjectCreatorPage.xaml.cs`)**:
  - Integrated dedicated **Canva Creative Cloud Bridge** card in the desktop Project Creator.
  - Added **"Create on Canva (Auto-size)"** 1-click launcher that reads selected platform preset specs (1:1 Feed 1080x1080, 9:16 Story 1080x1920, 16:9 Banner 1920x1080, A4/A3/A5 print dimensions) and launches Canva in the default browser pre-configured with exact pixel/mm dimensions (`https://www.canva.com/create/?width={w}&height={h}&unit={px|mm}`).
  - Added `CanvaUrlInput` field with **"Test Link"** button for pasting design URLs.
  - Added `"Canva (.url)"` to starter canvas extension selector.

  - Implemented automatic Base64-to-disk decoding and caching (`avatar_{staffId}.jpg`) from Synology NAS `staff_directory.json` to Desktop `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SuamiSihat\`.
  - Added auto-sync check on `UserProfileService.LoadProfile()`: Desktop now automatically validates and mirrors avatars updated from Web Portal or Android.
  - Added bi-directional reverse sync (`UserProfileService.SyncAvatarToNas`): changing avatar on Desktop encodes to Base64 JPEG data URI and persists to NAS `staff_directory.json` for instant propagation across Web and Android.
  - Updated `MainWindow` sidebar and `SettingsPage` preview to decode and render both Base64 Data URIs and local files seamlessly.
- **Visual Gantt Timeline Off-Day Shading, Day Labels & Conflict Prevention (`CalendarPage.xaml`, `CalendarPage.xaml.cs`, `CategoryPresetService.cs`, `MalaysiaHolidayService.cs`, `ProjectGanttView.svelte`)**:
  - Added two-tier stacked column headers across the Gantt timeline showing day-of-week letters (`M`, `T`, `W`, `T`, `F`, `S`, `Sun`) and day numbers.
  - Color-coded badges and styling for Today (brand blue), Sundays (coral/red accent), Saturdays (slate neutral), and Malaysia Public Holidays (bold red with flag 🇲🇾).

  - Replicated holiday recognition, off-day column shading, and schedule conflict tags in Web Portal Gantt view (`ProjectGanttView.svelte`).
- **Release Packaging**:
  - Rebuilt WPF Desktop executable using MSBuild 4.8 in Release mode with Costura.Fody single-file embedding.
  - Updated `dist/SS-CAM.exe` and `dist/SS-CAM-v4.7.0.exe` (AssemblyVersion and FileVersion `4.7.0.0`).

- **Synology NAS `_Orders` Temporary Attachment Vault (`OrderService.js`, `api.js`)**:
  - Implemented dedicated temporary intake directory `\\SSNAS\Creative-Team\_Orders\<ORDER_ID>\` acting as an asset staging vault for creative requests prior to project folder creation.
  - Safe underscore prefix (`_Orders`) ensures directory scanners (`WorkspaceScanner.cs`, `WorkspaceService.js`) ignore temporary folders and never collide with year containers (`2026/`).
  - Automatic JSON-Lines sync to `_Orders/creative-orders.jsonl` on the NAS with fallback redundancy.
- **Web Portal Multi-File Upload Dropzone (`OrderFormView.svelte`, `api.js`)**:
  - Integrated modern Fluent 2 drag-and-drop file uploader in the "New Creative Request" modal supporting multiple attachments up to 50MB per file (PNG, JPG, WebP, PDF, PSD, AI, ZIP, MP4, DOCX).
  - Attached files stream to the server via `multipart/form-data` or base64 JSON payload and are written safely into the order's NAS vault.
- **Role Detection & Action Visibility Fix (`OrderFormView.svelte`)**:
  - Fixed role check bug where users with composite roles like `"Admin, Designer"` (e.g. Harussani) had action buttons, status dropdowns, and designer assignment controls hidden.
  - Enhanced role matcher to check composite role strings, token arrays, and case-insensitivity.
- **Order Details Drawer & Attachment Actions (`OrderFormView.svelte`)**:
  - Added "Attached Reference Files" section listing all files with sizes, upload timestamps, and direct actions.
  - 👁️ Preview / open media in browser, ⬇️ Download original file, and ❌ Safe delete.

  - 📥 **"Copy All Attachments to Project (01_BRIEF_ASSETS)"**: 1-click action to copy all staged assets into the linked project's brief folder on the NAS.
- **Desktop Project Creator Order Discovery & Ingestion (`ProjectCreatorPage.xaml`, `ProjectCreatorPage.xaml.cs`, `CreativeOrderService.cs`)**:
  - Added `LinkedOrderComboBox` to the desktop Project Creator page, automatically discovering pending orders from `_Orders/creative-orders.jsonl` with live attachment counts (`[📎 N files]`).
  - Added **Sync** button for instant order list refreshing.
  - Selecting an order automatically populates the project title, selects the matching sub-brand, populates the brief remarks with requester information, and displays an attachment count badge.
  - Generating the project folder automatically copies all files from `_Orders/<ORDER_ID>/` into `targetDir\01_BRIEF_ASSETS\`, sets `order_id: <ORDER_ID>` in `README.md` frontmatter, and updates order status to `in_progress`.
- **Ecosystem Test Suite & Build Verification**:
  - Added Test 30 to Web Portal test suite verifying NAS attachment save, list, download, and project ingestion (30/30 passed, 100%).
  - Verified Source Guardian (9/9 passed), compiled Release desktop binary (`5.42 MB`), and executed post-build Smoke Test suite cleanly.

## [4.6.1] - 2026-09-04 (Cross-Platform Creative Orders Real-Time Sync, Order Requests Scaffolding Engine & Desktop Startup Resilience)

  - Automatic JWT authentication and live queue fetching ensuring Desktop, Web Portal, and Android Companion app display the exact same active orders in real time.
  - Dual-layer persistence: live cloud orders are automatically cached to the local Synology NAS ledger (`_Team\Orders\creative-orders.jsonl`) for offline resilience and local file-watcher integration.
  - Instant bidirectional status propagation: converting or updating an order on Desktop immediately issues an HTTP `PATCH /api/orders/{id}` to the central cloud API, reflecting `in_progress` status on Web and Mobile instantly.
- **Desktop 1-Click Project Scaffolding Engine (`CreativeOrderService.ConvertOrderToProjectAsync`)**:
  - Automatically calculates canonical next project ID (`NNNNX`), scaffolds standard 4-folder project vaults (`01_Brief_and_Copy`, `02_Source_Assets`, `03_Artwork_Design`, `04_Final_Exports`), auto-generates `01_Brief_and_Copy/COPY.md` containing the requester's approved script, and writes `README.md` with YAML frontmatter linking the order ID.
- **Desktop Startup Sequence & Splash Screen Hang Resolution (`App.xaml`, `App.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml`)**:
  - Fixed WPF-UI icon symbol compilation clash by updating legacy `ClipboardTasklist24` to canonical `ClipboardTask24`.

  - Added robust diagnostic file logging (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SuamiSihat\startup_trace.log`) and individual `try/catch` safety guards across all `MainWindow.OnLoaded` initialization routines.
- **Desktop Task Manager Kanban Overdue Suppression (`ProjectStatus.cs`, `TaskManagerPage.xaml.cs`)**:
  - Strict completed status checking (`IsCompletedStatus = status == "done" || status == "approved" || status == "completed"`).
  - Completed projects suppress the red overdue badge (`IsOverdue = false`), rendering deadlines in clean emerald green (`#10B981`) text and excluding them from the top "URGENT / OVERDUE" metric glance.
  - Neutralized queue age badge to slate (`#64748B`) on finished projects.
- **Frontmatter YAML String Sanitization (`FrontmatterService.cs`, `ProjectStatusItem.cs`)**:
  - Automatically strip surrounding quotes (`"..."` / `'...'`) on frontmatter values during extraction, resolving unparsed raw ISO strings into clean formatted dates (`yyyy-MM-dd`). Full parity across Windows WPF and Linux Avalonia.
- **Web Portal Creative Direction Matrix Preview & Header Toggle (`ProjectDetailView.svelte`, `api.js`)**:
  - Creative Direction tab defaults to clean read-only preview cards with live color swatch chips parsed from hex tokens.
  - Relocated Edit/Save/Cancel actions into the top header group with loading spinner feedback and atomic `README.md` persistence.

  - Defaulted editor mode to Preview (`preview`), eliminated fixed 720px height clipping, enabled natural vertical expansion, and added a sticky toolbar.
- **Shared Team Board Test Isolation (`ApprovalService.js`)**:
  - Automated sandbox test suites (`9998A`) are strictly isolated from posting mock items to the live Synology NAS `_Team/team-notes.json`.
- **Android Companion App Release (`src/SS-CAM.Android`)**:
  - Bumped version to `4.6.1` (versionCode `462`).
  - Cryptographically signed release AAB (`app-release.aab`) and standalone release APK (`app-release.apk`) verified with 2048-bit RSA key.

- **Official SuamiSihat Radio Stream Integration (`RadioStreamService.cs`)**:
  - Integrated official SuamiSihat Radio Stream (`https://dj.suamisihat.myds.me/listen/suamisihat-radio/radio.mp3`) as pinned `#1` preset station with live audio playback.
  - Automatic station migration preserving user custom radio presets.
- **Deep Month-Container Project Vault Discovery (`WorkspaceScanner.cs`, `WorkloadSlaService.cs`, `CopywritingPage.xaml.cs`)**:
  - Updated project directory matching regex from `^\d{6}_([A-Z0-9]+)` to `^\d{6}_(\d[A-Z0-9]*)` to prevent premature stoppage at intermediate month containers (e.g. `202608_August`), correctly indexing nested projects (`202608_0001D_SS_brand campaign`).
- **Dynamic Project ID Auto-Calculation Overhaul (`ProjectCreatorPage.xaml.cs`)**:
  - Implemented multi-tier directory scanning (`ScanDirectoryForMaxProjectId`) checking active month containers, year folders, and local workspaces to reliably calculate the next sequential project ID (e.g., `0001D` -> `0002P` -> `0003D`).
- **Copywriting Studio Default FlowDocument Markdown Rendering (`CopywritingPage.xaml` & `CopywritingPage.xaml.cs`)**:
  - Script canvas now renders rich formatted Markdown preview by default when loading or selecting projects.
  - Added compact icon-only mode toggles (`Eye24` for Preview, `Edit24` for Edit) with real-time text sync and automated focus switching.
- **Catalog Designer Resolution & System Folder Filtering (`SearchCopyPage.xaml.cs` & `WorkspaceScanner.cs`)**:
  - Sanitized Designer filter to load active team members from `UserProfileService.GetStaffDirectory()` while stripping out NAS system/year folders (`#recycle`, `2026`).
  - Added `ResolveProjectDesigner` to accurately attribute projects to designers via frontmatter, job codes (`0001D`, `0004P`), and staff directory.
- **UI Control & ComboBox Layout Enhancements (`SearchCopyPage.xaml`)**:
  - Increased ComboBox heights, padding, and vertical centering to eliminate text clipping across Windows scaling modes.

### Fixed — Dashboard, Role Filtering & Scroll
- **Dashboard Designer Workload — Year Bug (`WorkloadSlaService.cs`)**:
  - Fixed `ComputeDesignerWorkloads` returning year folders (`2026`) as designer names instead of actual designer names. Overhauled to seed staff directory members and traverse nested project vaults via `ResolveProjectDesigner`.
- **Manager Role Excluded from All Metrics & Filters**:
  - Added `IsDesignerOrAdminRole` predicate to `WorkloadSlaService.cs` to exclude Manager / CEO / Executive roles from Designer Workload & Capacity Radar (Desktop & Web).
  - Updated `WorkspaceScanner.GetDesignerFolders` to filter out management staff from all designer dropdown filters.
  - Updated `TaskManagerPage.xaml.cs` and `CalendarPage.xaml.cs` `PopulateDesignerFilter()` to exclude any manager-role entries derived from project metadata.
  - Updated Web portal `WorkspaceService.js` and `TeamService.js` to exclude manager roles from dashboard metrics and team directory filter.
- **Mouse Wheel Scrolling Restored Across All Pages**:
  - Diagnosed root cause: `PreviewMouseWheel` event not wired on root `ScrollViewer` for 10+ pages; inner controls (ListBox, ComboBox, FlowDocumentScrollViewer) swallowing wheel events.
  - Added global `OnGlobalPreviewMouseWheel` handler on `MainWindow` `NavigationView` — walks visual tree to find nearest scrollable `ScrollViewer`, performs step-clamped `LineUp()`/`LineDown()`/`LineLeft()`/`LineRight()`. Covers all pages automatically.
  - Per-page `PreviewMouseWheel` wire-up added to all 10 broken pages: `DashboardPage`, `WorkstationHealthPage`, `WellbeingPage`, `SettingsPage`, `WaktuSolatPage`, `QrCodePage`, `ProjectCreatorPage`, `RadioPage`, `TaskManagerPage`, `DesignTokensPage`.
  - Added missing `OnScrollViewerPreviewMouseWheel` handler to `TaskManagerPage.xaml.cs` and `DesignTokensPage.xaml.cs`.
  - `TaskManagerPage` kanban board now also supports **horizontal mouse wheel scrolling** through columns.

  - **Aligned Now-Playing Layout**: Aligned Station Name + Emerald Green `LIVE` Pill on Line 1, and `NOW PLAYING:` tag + track subtext on Line 2, centered vertically alongside the 40x40 cover image.
- **Top Hero Featured Radio Player Banner**: Refactored `RadioPage.xaml` into a 4-row layout featuring a Top Hero Featured Station Banner, eliminating player redundancy.
- **Strict Equal-Height Dashboard KPI Grid**: Enforced `UniformGrid Rows="2" Columns="4" Height="224"` with `VerticalAlignment="Stretch"` on all 8 KPI widgets for 100% uniform cell heights across all rows.
- **Sidebar Cleanup**: Removed redundant radio status text from left navigation sidebar footer (`PaneFooter`).

### Fixed & Remediated
- **Source Guardian Checks**: Resolved all UTF-8 BOM encoding issues and verified full Fluent 2 design compliance across all XAML and C# files.
- **TitleBar Background Mismatches**: Removed white background behind user profile card and window control buttons.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added — Phase 1: High-Impact UI/UX Modernization
- **Dashboard Metric Cards**: Standardized rhythm with large relative time readouts ("Today", "2 days ago") and elevated Fluent 2 `<ui:Card>` containers.

- **Deep Adobe/Figma App Bridge**: Added dynamic canvas launcher button ("Open in Photoshop / Illustrator / Affinity") to Project Creator upon canvas generation.
- **One-Click Project Finalizer**: Integrated "Finalize & Archive..." feature into Search & Copy inspector. Automatically locates and compresses `04_Production`/`_Deliverables` and `01_Artwork_Design`/`_Raw_Assets` into standardized ZIP archives.
- **Dependencies**: Added `System.IO.Compression` and `System.IO.Compression.FileSystem` assembly references to `SS-CAM.csproj`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed — Critical (P0)

- **`FrontmatterService.ParseFrontmatter`** — Parser discarded all successfully-parsed key-value pairs when a README.md was missing its closing `---` delimiter (fell through to `return null`). Changed to `return result` so partially-formed frontmatter is still honoured. Affected Task Manager column placement for any project with a malformed README.

### Fixed — High (P1)

- **Theme toggle** — `OnStatusThemeToggle` event handler existed but had no XAML binding. Added `MouseLeftButtonDown` and `Cursor="Hand"` to the Theme status row in the sidebar footer with a `ToolTip` describing the cycle order (SS Default → Falconia → Metamorphosis).
- **Orphaned handlers removed** — `OnOpenGithub` and `OnOpenAboutWindow` were dead code-behind methods with no XAML targets. Removed to reduce maintenance surface.
- **Dead sidebar-collapse fields removed** — `isSidebarExpanded` (bool) and `_lastActiveNavBtn` (Button) were written but never read. These were remnants of the pre-WPF-UI custom sidebar. Removed; compiler warnings eliminated.

### Fixed — Medium (P2)

- **Hardcoded `D:\Testing` workspace default** — `DashboardPage`, `SearchCopyPage`, and `ProjectCreatorPage` all used `D:\Testing` as the initial `workspaceRoot` value. Changed to `string.Empty` so unconfigured installs show an empty/graceful state instead of silently scanning a non-existent path.
- **Team Board offline write** — `TeamBoardService.GetNotesPath` previously created the `_Team` folder on whatever path was provided, including local fallbacks. Added an early guard (`Directory.Exists(workspaceRoot)`) that returns `null` for inaccessible roots. `Save()` now checks for a `null` path and returns `false` immediately, propagating the correct error to the UI.
- **Workstation Health rescan count** — `OnRescanSoftwareClicked` showed a hardcoded "11 design software packages" confirmation regardless of actual scan results. Refactored to call `ScanInstalledDesignSoftware()` once and use the real count with proper pluralisation.
- **Static `HttpClient`** — `FetchDesignArticlesAsync` created a new `HttpClient` instance per fetch. Replaced with a `private static readonly HttpClient _httpClient` singleton on `DashboardPage` to prevent socket exhaustion. `UserAgent` is now cleared and re-set on each call.
- **Quick Notes H3 preview** — `RenderPreview` handled `# H1` and `## H2` but had no branch for `### H3`. Added `###` case with `FontSize=14, FontWeight=SemiBold`. Corrected check order to `### → ## → #` to prevent prefix collision.

### Fixed — Low (P3)

- **Silent `catch {}` blocks** — `FrontmatterService` (ReadStatus, WriteStatus) and `TeamBoardService` (LoadNotes, Save, GetNotesPath) now log exceptions via `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine` with `[ServiceName]` prefixes instead of silently discarding errors. Aligns with AGENTS.md error-handling rules.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added — Quick Notes Module
- **`QuickNotePage`** — Full-page Markdown note editor backed by `QuickNoteService`. Notes are saved as `.md` files in `%APPDATA%\SS-CAM\notes\` with automatic 3-second debounce via `DispatcherTimer`.
- **Sidebar nav item** (📝 Quick Notes) between Radio Player and Workstation Health.

### Added — Task Manager Module
- **`TaskManagerPage`** — Kanban-style board reading project status from `README.md` YAML frontmatter via `FrontmatterService`. Columns: Not Started · In Progress · Review · Done · On Hold.
- **Inline drawer** — Clicking a project card opens a slide-in editor with status, priority, deadline, and brief fields that writes back to frontmatter on save.
- **Sidebar nav item** (🗂 Task Manager) between Quick Notes and Workstation Health.

### Added — Team Board (Dashboard)
- **Team Board card** on the Dashboard page — displays last 10 shared notes from `_Team/team-notes.json` on NAS, with Author, timestamp, pin toggle, and delete actions.
- **Post Note input row** — Post a message visible to all team members; falls back gracefully when NAS is offline.
- **30-second auto-refresh** via `DispatcherTimer` that starts/stops cleanly with page navigation lifecycle.

### Added — Services
- **`QuickNoteService`** — Load/save personal Markdown notes to `%APPDATA%\SS-CAM\notes\`.
- **`FrontmatterService`** — Read and write YAML frontmatter blocks (`--- ... ---`) in any Markdown file without disturbing body content. Includes `BuildDefaultFrontmatter()` for new projects.
- **`TeamBoardService`** — Load, post, pin/unpin, and delete team notes via a shared `_Team/team-notes.json` file on the NAS workspace root.

### Changed — Project Creator: Frontmatter Injection
- **README.md now includes YAML frontmatter** — Every newly created project folder generates a `README.md` prefixed with a default frontmatter block (`status`, `priority`, `designer`, `brand`, `deadline`, `revision`, `tags`) so the Task Manager can index it from day one.
- Sub-brand code is extracted from the ComboBox selection and written into the `brand:` field automatically.

### Changed — Navigation
- **MainWindow nav** — Two new nav buttons registered and routed: Quick Notes (icon `&#xE70B;`) and Task Manager (icon `&#xE9D5;`).

### Changed — Version
- Version badge bumped from `v2.3.6` → `v2.5.0` in `DashboardPage.xaml` and window title.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-10 (Latest Stable Release)

### Added — Dashboard: Designer Inspiration Widget
- **Designer Insight card** — Full-width widget below the metric tiles showing a rotating pool of 40 curated design tips (colour theory, print production, typography, file hygiene, brand discipline, creative wellbeing, and more).
- **Auto-advance timer** — Tips rotate automatically every 60 seconds via a `DispatcherTimer` that is cleanly stopped on page unload.
- **Next Tip button** — Manually advance to the next tip at any time.
- **Smashing Magazine RSS feed** — Toggle the "Articles" button to fetch and display the 5 latest design articles from Smashing Magazine as clickable links. Falls back silently to offline tip pool if the network is unavailable or times out (6-second threshold).

### Changed — Project Creator: Three Refinements
- **Editable canvas extension** — `TemplateExtensionComboBox` is now editable (`IsEditable="True"`), allowing designers to type any custom file extension (e.g. `.indd`, `.sketch`, `.fla`). The live directory tree preview and the generated file on disk reflect the typed value immediately.
- **Project Brief → Markdown Editor** — Replaced the 64px `ui:TextBox` for *Project Brief / Remarks* with a taller 200px scrollable `TextBox` preceded by a 6-button **Markdown toolbar**: Bold (`**`), Italic (`*`), Inline Code (`` ` ``), H2 Heading (`##`), List Item (`-`), and Horizontal Rule (`---`). Toolbar buttons wrap or prefix selected text; if no text is selected they insert a placeholder. The richer Markdown content is written verbatim into `README.md` on folder creation.
- **Checkbox labels cleaned** — Removed numeric folder-prefix noise from checkbox labels: `Include 05_Revisions folder` → `Include Client Revisions folder`, `Include 06_Raw_Media folder` → `Include Raw Media folder`. The created folder names on disk are unchanged.

### Changed — Search & Copy: Catalog Book Layout
- **Catalog book layout** — Completely redesigned from a wide DataGrid + narrow sidebar to a **270px fixed sidebar + dominant README pane**: the right README preview now fills all available vertical height using `DockPanel.LastChildFill` rather than a fixed `Height="360"` DataGrid.
- **Project sidebar cards** — Replaced the `DataGrid` with a styled `ListBox` of folder cards. Each card shows a folder icon glyph, project name, and a compact metadata line (`files · size · modified date`). Selected card is highlighted with `FluentBrandLight` background and `FluentBrandTint` border.
- **Mode toggle strip** — PREVIEW / Raw / Gallery toggle buttons moved from below the search bar into the selected project header badge for immediate access without scrolling.
- **Action buttons docked to footer** — Copy Path and Copy Whole Project Folder buttons repositioned to a docked footer panel at the bottom of the right pane, keeping the README preview area unobstructed.
- **Live project count** — The sidebar header now shows a live count label (e.g. "42 projects") that updates after every search.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-08-06 (Stable Release)

### Fixed
- **Version badge showing wrong version** — The dashboard version badge (`TxtVersionBadge`) was displaying `v2.1.0` at runtime because it is populated dynamically from `AssemblyVersion`. Updated `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` to `2.3.6.0`, `CurrentVersion` const in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, the hardcoded "Check for Updates" dialog in `SettingsPage.xaml.cs`, and the fallback XAML strings in `AboutWindow.xaml` and `DashboardPage.xaml`.

### Changed — Fluent 2 Design System Compliance
- **Segoe Fluent Icons** — Replaced all emoji used in UI chrome (buttons, headers, status indicators) with proper `Segoe Fluent Icons` font glyphs across all pages:
  - `DashboardPage`: Refresh button `&#xE72C;`, project folder icon `&#xED25;`
  - `WellbeingPage`: Focus `&#xE7C3;`, Break `&#xEA86;`, Breathing `&#xE9F5;`, info icon `&#xE82F;`
  - `SearchCopyPage`: Search `&#xE721;`, Copy Path `&#xE8C8;`, Copy Folder `&#xE7C5;`, Image Gallery `&#xEB9F;`
  - `RadioPage`: Header icon `&#xE768;`, Import `&#xE8B5;`, Reset `&#xE72C;`, Add Stream `&#xE710;`, Hero icon `&#xE768;`
- **Token-based colour system** — Removed all raw hex colour literals from `WellbeingPage.xaml`, `SearchCopyPage.xaml`, `RadioPage.xaml`. All foreground, background, border, and status colours now reference `FluentBrand80`, `FluentLightTextPrimary`, `FluentLightTextSecondary`, `FluentLightCardBg`, `FluentLightCardSubBg`, `FluentLightStroke`, `FluentBrandLight`, `FluentBrandTint`, `FluentDanger`, and `FluentSuccess` token brushes defined in `Styles/Fluent2Styles.xaml`.
- **Typography consistency** — Applied `{StaticResource FluentFontFamily}` to all TextBlocks that previously used hard-coded `Segoe UI Variable Text` or `Segoe UI Variable Display` font family strings.
- **Button spec** — All primary action buttons now use `FluentBrand80` background / White foreground with `BorderThickness="0"` and `Cursor="Hand"`. Secondary buttons use `FluentLightCardSubBg`. Danger-zone buttons use `FluentDanger`.

  - **Interactive Station Grid & Visualizer**: Station cards with category filter tabs (`⭐ Favorites`, `Focus`, `Pop/Hits`, `Talk/News`, `Jazz/Chill`, `Custom`) and animated EQ visualizer bars during active playback.
  - **Configuration Persistence**: Automatically saves custom streams, starred favorites, last played station, and volume preferences to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SuamiSihat\radio_config.json`.

## [1.9.10] - 2026-08-04 (Stable Release)

### Added
- **Creative Wellbeing Module** – A completely local, private companion for designers to help maintain healthy work habits.
  - **Focus Timer**: Includes monotonic stopwatch tracking for standard focus, deep flow, and gentle focus sessions. Automatically detects when you're idle and safely pauses sessions.
  - **Wellbeing Check-Ins**: Quick interface to rate energy and pressure levels, supporting self-reflection.
  - **Fatigue Rule Engine**: Suggests appropriate rests or breathing breaks based on work duration and recorded check-ins without any diagnostic labeling.
  - **Mind Drops**: Instantly capture blocking thoughts during a session; saved securely with DPAPI encryption to remain completely private to your Windows user account.
  - **Zero Telemetry**: All data is kept strictly on your local disk at `%LOCALAPPDATA%` with zero cloud sync or network footprint.

### Fixed
- **Window Icon** — Fixed an issue where the WPF Window taskbar icon and title bar were displaying as the default PowerShell logo by loading the `suamisihat-logo-on-dark-ui.png` directly as the WPF `Window.Icon` instead of relying on `.ico` format parsing.

## [1.9.9] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

## [1.9.8] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

### Added
- **Collapsible sidebar** — Added a hamburger menu button in the header (top left) that allows the sidebar to be collapsed/expanded to maximize workspace area.

### Fixed
- **Circular avatar profile picture** — Fixed the avatar picture displaying as a square by updating the `Image` to a `Border` with a rounded `CornerRadius` using an `ImageBrush` background, making it perfectly circular.

## [1.9.7] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

## [1.9.6] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

### Added

- **Avatar click-to-preview** — clicking the circular profile photo in the sidebar now opens a full-size image popup (`860×660` resizable dark window). The click is captured via `PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown` with `Handled=true` so it doesn't trigger the NavProfile navigation.
- **Department/role in sidebar** — the subtitle under the designer name now shows the department/role from User Profile settings (e.g. "Design Lead"), falling back to "User Profile" when empty. Implemented via a new `DepartmentDisplay` computed property on `AppViewModel` that reacts to `Department` changes.
- **Production / Export thumbnail tab** — a new third tab in the Search & Copy right panel scans `Production`, `Export`, `Exports`, `Output`, and `Outputs` subfolders of the selected project for image files (`.png .jpg .jpeg .gif .bmp .tiff .webp`). Results appear as `160×120` thumbnail cards in a `WrapPanel`; clicking any card opens the full-size popup.
- **Animated header** — the dark navy header has a looping PS Vita-style animation of 8 semi-transparent floating circle outlines (`Ellipse`, white stroke, 5–9% opacity). Driven by a 33 ms `DispatcherTimer`; shapes wrap around canvas edges. Timer is stopped cleanly on `Window.Closed`.

## [1.9.5] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

### Fixed

- **Avatar image** uploaded in User Profile is now shown in the sidebar immediately after saving. Previously the sidebar always displayed the static person placeholder icon regardless of `AvatarPath`. The fix adds a named `<Image>` overlay in the sidebar XAML, a new `Update-AvatarDisplay` helper that loads the image via `BitmapImage.BeginInit/EndInit`, and wires it up on `ContentRendered`, every `AvatarPath` property change, and after `Save-WpfSettings`.

### Verification

## [1.9.4] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

### Fixed

- **Job ID code** no longer stays stuck on `D` when switching creative presets. Changing the preset now immediately updates the suffix letter in the Job ID field (e.g. `0003D` → `0003S` for Social, `0003V` for Video, `0003P` for Brand Identity).
- **README preview** in Search & Copy no longer shows YAML frontmatter (`---` block). Frontmatter is now stripped before the FlowDocument renderer processes the file.
- **Asset folder cards** text is no longer cropped. Changed fixed `Height="132"` to `MinHeight="132"` so card height grows to fit the subtitle text.

### Verification

- Smoke test passed for Projects, BrandAssets, Search, Dashboard, Settings, and Setup views.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-08-04 (Pre-release)

### Changed

- Update checker now shows a **Yes/No dialog** when a newer version is available, with a direct link to the GitHub release download page.
- Update checker status text now confirms the running version when already up to date: `You are running the latest version (vX.Y.Z)`.
- Hardcoded fallback version strings in `Get-SuamiSihatLatestRelease` and `Build-Installer.ps1` bumped to `1.9.3` for consistency.

- Public Brand Assets link and updated Internal Assets endpoint.
- Font Awesome Free vector icons and SuamiSihat favicon integration for the window, taskbar, and report dialogs.
- Custom master-canvas extension entry and designer-based project-folder filtering.

### Changed

- Job IDs now place their work-type code after the sequential number, for example `0001D` and `0001S`.
- Legacy prefix-format IDs such as `D0001` remain readable and migrate to the suffix format in application state.
- Sub-brand selectors now display the full registered business names while project folders retain concise codes.
- Project Management separates project/template inputs from generated location and subfolder structure.
- Search operates on project-folder names and loads the selected project's `README.md` and file list.

### Installer

- Brand Kit installation registers its asset path for conditional module discovery.
- Express and Custom installation retain the four-step component, configuration, licence, and report flow.
- Brand Kit options are skipped when Brand Kit is not selected.
- Uninstall controls remain hidden when no Creative Project Management installation is detected.
